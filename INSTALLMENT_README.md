## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Order with Installments

```bash
POST /api/order
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orderNumber": "ORD-2024-001",
  "employeeId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "total": 6000.00,
  "subtotal": 5500.00,
  "tax": 500.00,
  "paymentType": "INSTALLMENT",
  "installmentMonths": 3,
  "paymentMethod": "PAYROLL_DEDUCTION"
}
```

**Result:** System automatically creates 6 installments (3 months × 2 cutoffs)

### 2. Query Pending Installments

```bash
GET /api/installment/pending-payroll?cutoffDate=2024-01-15
```

**Returns:** All installments due for the cutoff date

### 3. Mark as Deducted

```bash
POST /api/installment/{id}/deduct
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payrollBatchId": "BATCH-2024-01-15",
  "deductionReference": "DED-2024-001234"
}
```

**Result:** Updates status to DEDUCTED with timestamp

## 📊 How It Works

### Bi-Monthly Schedule

```
Month 1:  │──── 15th ────│──── End ────│
          │   Cutoff 1   │   Cutoff 2   │
          │   Payment    │   Payment    │

Month 2:  │──── 15th ────│──── End ────│
          │   Cutoff 3   │   Cutoff 4   │
          │   Payment    │   Payment    │

Month 3:  │──── 15th ────│──── End ────│
          │   Cutoff 5   │   Cutoff 6   │
          │   Payment    │   Payment    │
```

### Example: 3-Month Plan (₱6,000)

| Installment | Cutoff Date | Payment Date | Amount |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ |
| 1           | Jan 15      | Jan 20       | ₱1,000 |
| 2           | Jan 31      | Feb 5        | ₱1,000 |
| 3           | Feb 15      | Feb 20       | ₱1,000 |
| 4           | Feb 28/29   | Mar 5        | ₱1,000 |
| 5           | Mar 15      | Mar 20       | ₱1,000 |
| 6           | Mar 31      | Apr 5        | ₱1,000 |

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Located in `helper/installmentService.ts`:

```typescript
const PAYROLL_CUTOFFS = {
	FIRST: 15, // 15th of each month
	SECOND: "END_OF_MONTH", // Last day of month
};

const DAYS_AFTER_CUTOFF = 5; // Payment processed 5 days after cutoff
```

Modify these if your payroll schedule is different.

## 🔄 Payroll Integration Workflow

```
1. On Cutoff Date (15th or End of Month)
   └─> GET /api/installment/pending-payroll

2. Process Payroll for Each Employee
   ├─> Verify employee is active
   ├─> Check sufficient salary balance
   └─> Deduct installment amounts

3. After Successful Deduction
   └─> POST /api/installment/{id}/deduct

4. Handle Failed Deductions
   └─> PATCH /api/installment/{id} with status: "FAILED"
```
